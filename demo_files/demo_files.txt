If you’re using Word 95 or lower (or if you’re 
tired of that quick brown fox), you can use the 
traditional Latin “Lorem ipsum dolor . . . ,” 
which has been used as placeholder text for centuries:

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing 
elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut 
laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat. Ut wisi
enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ulliam 
corper suscipit lobortis nisl ut aliquip ex ea commodo 
consequat. Duis autem veleum iriure dolor in hendrerit 
in vulputate velit esse molestie consequat, vel willum 
lunombro dolore eu feugiat nulla facilisis at vero eros 
et accumsan et iusto odio dignissim qui blandit praesent 
luptatum zzril delenit augue duis dolore te feugait nulla 
facilisi.

If you’re curious about this, it’s a garbled quotation 
from Cicero’s De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (On the Ends 
of Good and Bad), book 1, paragraph 32, which reads, 
“Neque porro quisquam est, qui dolorem ipsum, quia dolor 
sit, amet, consectetur, adipisci velit,” meaning, “There 
is no one who loves pain itself, who seeks after it and 
wants to have it, simply because it is pain.” The book 
was popular during the Renaissance, when the passage was 
used in a book of type samples for that wonderful new 
technology, printing.
